# Path-Based Processing Update ✅

## Changes Made

The application has been successfully updated to use **file system paths** instead of file uploads.

### 🔄 **Key Changes:**

1. **Form Update**: Changed from file upload to textarea for path input
2. **Route Update**: New `/process-paths` endpoint instead of `/upload`
3. **Processing Logic**: Direct folder access instead of file upload handling
4. **Validation**: Added path validation to ensure TOXSWA structure exists
5. **UI Updates**: Updated all text and instructions to reflect path-based approach

### 📝 **New Workflow:**

1. **Enter Project Paths**: Users provide full file system paths to TOXSWA project folders
2. **Path Validation**: Application checks that paths exist and contain required TOXSWA structure
3. **Direct Processing**: Application reads files directly from the provided paths
4. **Same Output**: Generates the same `.tpf` and `.bat` files as before

### 🎯 **Benefits:**

- **No File Upload**: Eliminates upload size limits and file transfer issues
- **Direct Access**: Faster processing since files are read directly from disk
- **Better Security**: No temporary file storage or upload handling
- **Simpler Workflow**: Users just provide paths instead of selecting files

### 📋 **Usage Example:**

Users now enter paths like:
```
C:\SwashProjects\BIXSC45_1AP
C:\SwashProjects\AnotherProject
/path/to/project/folder
```

### ✅ **Files Updated:**

- `templates/index.html` - Updated form and instructions
- `routes.py` - New path processing logic
- `README.md` - Updated documentation
- `SETUP_COMPLETE.md` - Updated setup instructions

### 🧪 **Testing:**

The application is running successfully on `http://localhost:8080` with the new path-based interface.

### 🎉 **Status:**

✅ **Application successfully converted to path-based processing!**

Users can now simply provide the file system paths to their TOXSWA project folders and the application will process them directly without any file uploads.
