      * Remarks : SWASH report helps you to set up the needed runs to calculate the PECsw and PECsed, occuring in the EU
      *           for the selected substance, used on the selected crop. The scenario code informs you which models you need to
      *           run for this scenario.
      *           D1-D6: drainage entries calculated by the MACRO model, fate in surface water calculated by the TOXSWA model
      *                  
      *           R1-R4: runoff and erosion entries calculated by the PRZM model, fate in surface water calculated by the TOXSWA model
      *                  
      *
      *           For STREAMS the Mean Deposition and Mass Loading, as calculated by the FOCUS Drift Calculator, have been multiplied by a 
      *           factor 1.2 to account for pesticide mass incoming from the upstream catchment as decided by the FOCUS Surface Water 
      *           Scenarios Working Group.
