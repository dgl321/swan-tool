# Port Configuration Fix âœ…

## Issue Resolved

The original port 5000 was already in use by macOS ControlCenter (AirPlay Receiver), causing the "Address already in use" error.

## Solution Applied

- **Changed port from 5000 to 8080**
- **Updated host from '0.0.0.0' to '127.0.0.1'** for better security
- **Updated all documentation** to reflect the new port

## Current Status

âœ… **Application is now running successfully on port 8080**

## How to Access

Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8080
```

## Files Updated

- `run.py` - Updated port and host configuration
- `app.py` - Updated default port for direct execution
- `README.md` - Updated documentation
- `SETUP_COMPLETE.md` - Updated setup instructions

## Alternative Ports

If port 8080 is also in use, you can modify the port in:
- `run.py` line 25: `port=8080`
- `app.py` line 25: `port=8080`

Common alternative ports: 3000, 8000, 9000

## Verification

The application is now accessible and working correctly! ðŸŽ‰
